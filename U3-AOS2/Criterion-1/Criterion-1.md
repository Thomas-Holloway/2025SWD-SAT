# Project Brief
Many people enjoy to journal, especially before bed or early in the morning. Some people write in a book, but this can lead to losing entries, and is somewhat limited. 

The solution is a journal app, which allows the user to create a journal entry for a day, and write what they want within it. This will then be saved, and be available for access later. The user can create templates which have preset questions in them to answer. Having a digital journal also allows for greater privacy, as your phone is (usually) locked, requiring a password to open.

The client is a teenager, who enjoys journaling, at any time throughout their day. Other potential users are other people who also wish to make the change to digital journaling. 

Swift can be used to develop applications for the iPhone, which the client has. The language can also handle file storage, data structures like arrays, and as it is Object Oriented, there can be multiple types of entries.

The development of the solution is feasible, as it is not overly complicated. Although their are many journaling apps, lots do not work fully offline, or may have limited free features. Many people who journal on paper may wish to transition to digital journaling, but are worried about data loss from servers, which is not a concern for this app, as it is all stored locally.
